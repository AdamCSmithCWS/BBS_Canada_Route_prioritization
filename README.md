## Project to rank the accessibility and potential volunteer population living near to Canadian BBS routes.

For each BBS route in Canada:
1. Calculates the human population living within buffer distances of the start location. Requires separate download of the [Canada Census Data for 2021](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1b3653d7-a48e-4001-8046-e6964bebe286).
2. Summarizes the number of surveys run since 1966 and in the last 5 years.
3. Appends a route by year matrix showing which observer surveyed each route in which year (using anonymous observer indicators).
